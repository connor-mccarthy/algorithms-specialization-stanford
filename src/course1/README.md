## Weekly Programming Assignments and Problem Sets
* Every week there will be a new problem set and a new programming assignment.
* For each problem set you are allowed a maximum of two attempts in a 12-hour period (we'll use the best score).
* For each programming assignment you're allowed a maximum of 10 attempts in a 12-hour period (we'll use the best score).
* For the final exam, you're allowed one attempt per 24 hours.

## Grading
* To pass a problem set, you must get at least 4 of the 5 questions correct (80%).
* To pass a programming assignment, you must get all of the answers correct (100%).
* To pass the final exam, you must get at least 70% of the total points (7 out of 10).
* To pass the course, you must pass all of the problem sets, all of the programming assignments, and the final exam.

## Theory Problems
* These are totally optional theory questions (no deadlines or credit given).
We encourage you to attempt these questions and discuss them in the forums to develop a deeper understanding of the design and analysis of algorithms.
