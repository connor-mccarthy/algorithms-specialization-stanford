# Data Structures

**Point:** Organize data so that it can be accessed quickly and useful
**Examples**: lists, stacks, queues, heaps, search trees, hashtables, bloom filters, union-find, etc.
**Why so many?**: Different data structures support different sets of operations --> suitable for different types of tasks
**Rule of thumb:** Choose the "minimal" data structure that support all the operations you need (but ideally no superfluous ones)

## Levels of data science structure awareness

Level 0 -> "What's a data structure?"
Level 1 -> Cocktail party-level literacy
Level 2 -> "This problem calls out for a heap"
Level 3 -> "I only use data structures that I wrote myself"
